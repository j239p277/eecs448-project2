List of features and descriptions of exstimated complexity and time required to complete:

1. Add multi-day scheduling functionality

	To complete this task, we need to change the event object implementation from its final project 1 state
	to support more than one date object. Then we need to add the ability to add multiple days during the event's
	creation. This simply involves adding a loop that creates date objects. FileIO must be updated to store
	all days in a file. The time required to complete this task is about 3 hours.

2. Add a task list

	To complete this task, we must add a new member variable to the event object. Then, we must add prompts
	during event creation to add these tasks to our event. FileIO must be updated to store tasks for each
	event in a text file. The time required to complete this task is about 3 hours.

3. Update event creator view

	This task simply printing all information about an event to the console. This can easily be done with
	a set of for loops. The time required to complete this task is about 30 minutes.

4. Update event joining process (event attendee view)

	This task involves allowing attendees to now sign up for events across multiple days. Attendees must also
	now be able to sign up for tasks. The time required to complete this task and provide stability is about
	4 hours.
